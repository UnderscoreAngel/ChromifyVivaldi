To Install this theme you might need to enable CSS modifications on Vivaldi
head to vivaldi://experiments/ and checkmark "Enable CSS Modifications"

After this you need to specify a directory on the browser to read CSS modifications files, for simplicity, head to the root
directory of your Vivaldi installation and create a new folder

Then head to vivaldi settings, type in the address bar of the browser vivaldi://settings/appearance/ and look
for "CUSTOM UI MODIFICATIONS" and click on "select folder"

Now select the previous folder/directory you created in the root directory of the browser installation

After all of that head once more to the root directory of your browser, open the folder you created, and place the .CSS
file in there

Then Restart the browser

As an optional extra step, you might want to add the additional theme, for that head to vivaldi://settings/themes/
and select "open theme" and select the ExtraTheme.zip to add an additional icon and to fix the settings menu.
